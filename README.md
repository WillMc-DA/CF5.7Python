### This project placed me as an analyst for an existing company, Instacart.
#### Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already had very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My tasks were to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
